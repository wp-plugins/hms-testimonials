== Description ==

** Mega Changes **

* Templates have been redone. You now create your own templates using drag and drop.
* Custom fields! You can now add additional fields to your testimonials.
* You can now add an image to your testimonial. This allows you show a picture of the person who submitted the testimonial.

HMS Testimonials offers you three shortcodes and two widgets. The first shortcode allows you to show all of your testimonials, a group of testimonials or just a single testimonial. The second shortcode allows you to show all or a group of testimonials that rotate through one at a time. Our third shortcode will display a form on a page or post to alow your visitors to submit testimonials. This shortcode can be placed inside a page or a blog post. If your theme uses sidebars you can use one or both of the widgets we offer. The first widget does the same as our shortcode. It shows all, a group or just one testimonial. Our second widget rotates through the selected testimonials one at a time. After a few seconds it will fade out the old and fade in the new testimonial.

Create groups to display specific testimonials on different pages. You can change the order they are shown in using a simple drag and drop method.

Use the settings to allow access for your users to write testimonials about your company.
